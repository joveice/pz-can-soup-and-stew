# Project Zomboid Can Soup And Stew
This mod adds the ability to can soups and stews into cans using a can opener. A can opener can then be used to open them again.

Supports pouring out a open can.

Cooking 4 allows to can one Soup/Stew into 4 cans, Cooking 5 allows to can one Soup/Stew into two cans (higher carbs density).

Canned stews gets -2 happiness to counter the better hot tag.

This mod is for a private server, therefore I will not really take suggestions as it's created specifically for one small use case. But feel free to share your ideas.

Warning: I don't know LUA, I know other languages. I have checked that it had no errors in the log. But best practices and such might not have been followed.

Feedback is more than welcome!
